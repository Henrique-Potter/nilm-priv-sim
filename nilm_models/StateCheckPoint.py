class FileCheckpointManager():
  """A checkpoint manager backed by a file system.

  This checkpoint manager is a utility to save and load checkpoints. While
  the checkpoint manager is compatible with any nested structure supported by
  `tf.convert_to_tensor`, checkpoints may often represent the output of a
  `tff.templates.IterativeProcess`. For example, one possible use case would
  be to save the `ServerState` output of an iterative process created via
  `tff.learning`. This is comparable to periodically saving model weights and
  optimizer states during non-federated training.

  The implementation you find here is slightly different from
  `tf.train.CheckpointManager`. This implementation yields nested structures
  that are immutable whereas `tf.train.CheckpointManager` is used to manage
  `tf.train.Checkpoint` objects, which are mutable collections. Additionally,
  this implementation allows retaining the initial checkpoint as part of the
  total number of checkpoints that are kept.

  The checkpoint manager is intended only for allowing simulations to be
  resumed after interruption. In particular, it is intended to only restart the
  same simulation, run with the same version of TensorFlow Federated.
