# Utilities for federated learning research

This directory contains general utilities used by the other directories under
`research/`. Examples include utilities for saving checkpoints, writing metrics
to disk, and configuring experiments via command-line flags. For examples of
federated learning experiments using these utilities, see the
[`research/optimization`](https://github.com/google-research/federated/blob/master/optimization)
directory.

These utilities are considered experimental, and may be removed or changed at
any time.
